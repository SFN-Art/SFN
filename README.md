# SFN introduction
SFN is an exploratory experiment of combining Art NFT with token on EOS. Maximum supply = 2100. Here is the code open source address.

Because of destroyed private keys, SFN is no need trust, no inflation. It's reliable as BTC for freedom.

So, if BTC is valuable, why not SFN?

- SFN has been [listed on DefiBOX](https://eos.defibox.io/marketDetail/2051).

- Priority, Repurchase and more details please check the [official web](https://sfnart.carrd.co).

# Important Risk Notice
SFN is public on EOS blockchain, only an experiment or game.
Like Bitcoin, **no one is responsible for its value**. So, every investor or player need to be responsible for yourself if hold!


Private keys of [SFN smart contract](https://www.bloks.io/account/sfn.free) have been destroyed, but there may still contain unanticipated risks.
